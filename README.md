This is a repository for code used in the publication Chen et al. 2024 entitled "Neural circuit basis of placebo pain relief". 

# single-cell RNA-seq
  Code for scRNA-seq:
  * `DSSeurat_functions.R` - This file contains R functions used in the primary scRNA-seq analysis pipeline.
  * `PN_seq.R` - This file contains the complete R code to cluster cells and generate plots used for Chen et al. 2024 from raw cell x gene matrices.

Raw fastq files and cells x genes matrices can be found at the following Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) submission: X

# Ca2+ imaging 
Ca2+ activity of neurons extracted
* `rACC_Pn data` - This file contains the Ca2+ imaging data from rACC-Pn neurons procssed with EXTRACT.
* `PC_data` - This file contains the Ca2+ imaging data from PC neurons processed with EXTRACT.
